    "00238513_20180703_0951": "Introduction This work investigates the effectiveness and efficiency of a genetic algorithmbased local search heuristic for the multiagent vehicle routing problem .This solution methodology consists of two components namely a repair mechanism which repairs inconsistent route assignments caused during the initial phases of the evolutionary process and a neighbourhood structure that constrains the movement of agents such that routes remain open.These ideas were introduced into this research because previous studies showed that inconsistencies created in earlier stages of an evolutionary run hamper further exploration at later stages citepBaheti_COR, Baheti_ROAR. Constraining the motion of vehicles was found necessary otherwise inconsistency would arise when certain vehicles move beyond their respective zones citelikeyan20014multi. Unlike existing methods where time is considered to be an important factor in determining the best tour , we treat each agent individually i.e., finding the optimum tour for every single agent irrespective of other agents. Our proposed approach focuses on obtaining the globallyoptimum set of individual tours while simultaneously ensuring their feasibility along with consistently assigning the vehicles according to their designated areas. We show through computational experiments that the heuristics can recover from erratic starting point assignment. Further, our experimental results establish that the heuristics produce high quality solutions compared to current literature. This paper is organised as follows.

It was originally measured at 2.9cm x 24cm when first seen several months ago; now measurements show a maximum diameter of 2.5cm x 15mm. This represents an approximate 20% reduction in overall dimension. Perirectal fibrosis or scarring has developed which appears similar to normal healing post chemotherapy treatment. Fibrosis extends into adjacent organs around the site of a prior perirectal abscess. Six discrete masses are evident near this region that display varied echogenicity relative to surrounding tissue likely representing early metastases. Echotexture at one level suggests small lymph nodes, possibly mildly increased in size at this level (small).

    "00617881_20160812_1637": "stein Barr virus may lead way for new vaccineNew York Columbia University Medical Center scientists say recent findings could help researchers develop vaccines against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), one of six viruses linked to human cancer.They discovered that EBV hijacks the protein production machinery controlled by host cells and commandeers them into producing large amounts of proteins that favor survival and reproduction of the virus.Currently approved treatments for epithelial cancers like nasopharyngeal carcinoma induced by EBV require long hospital stays and extensive chemotherapy treatments leading to severe complications and poor quality of life post treatment.By understanding how EBV subverts cellular biogenesis, we might better design interventions that prevent or block EBV entry into epithelia, said study leader Yuan He.For now, much work needs to be done before trials begin because if this becomes a human cancer therapy, the consequences of blocking viral replication will need careful assessment since some viral genetic material in latently infected Bcells must remain intact so that reactivation cannot occur at a later time even though cell lines derived from the primary tumors showed evidence of dissemination of EBV.Still, the investigators believe this discovery provides insight into development of future diagnostic tools or therapeutic targets",

This question asks what types of lesions can occur when the innate immune system becomes compromised because of defects such as Bruton agammaglobulinemia. Patients lacking B cells do not produce adequate amounts of secretory IgA, which normally protects mucosal surfaces against bacterial infection. Hence, patients deficient in the production of secretory IgA suffer frequent gastrointestinal tract infections caused by organisms such as Campylobacter jejuni or Haemophilus influenzae. Thus, one might predict that if the individual had circulating antibody against these specific campylobactor jejuni organism, then perhaps the patient could have avoided this intestinal disease process and potentially prevented his death. In summary, even though one cannot alter the past, the speculation would exist whether or not he may have fared better clinically given normal innate immunity vs.",

Current amplitude depends only on the electrodes surface area and the electric resistance between them. If resistivity increases, then less charge passes through the circuit. To increase voltage output, one should use bipolar forceps that employ two tips separated by a gap of air or saline. Monopolar cautery probes transmit high frequencies through a long wire loop instead of tips. Such configurations waste energy. A constant current device maintains relatively constant current at a preset value despite changes in tissue thickness.

RNA extraction & cDNA synthesis Total RNAs were extracted using mirVana kit according to manufacture's instructions and first strand complementary DNA was obtained with M-MLV reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), followed by treatment with ribonuclease H (Promega Corp., Madison WI) to eliminate genomic DNA contaminants. Afterwards, real time PCR was performed using Taqman MicroRNA assays .These assay detects all miR species irrespective of sequence homology thus making this platform applicable in assessment of nonhomologous sequences (miRAGE detection format). To determine relative abundance compared with U6 snRNA, threshold cycle values were normalized against global miR-1914 which showed minimal changes across most samples. Normalization allows accurate quantification of low abundant miRNA such as let-7a, let-7a347 and miR-166.

Patients may need surgery depending upon their clinical status. Yes, the presence of the fistulae requires investigation using contrast studies (contrast radiography) or magnetic resonance imaging, possibly including endoanal ultrasound. Patient may develop cellulitis or even necrosis if untreated. This may occur at any point along the tract but usually occurs near the internal opening where drainage will occur.Sinus tracks involving the external sphincters and extending into the deeper portions of the external sphincter increase the risk of incontinence. Treatment often includes incision and drainage of any associated abscess cavity plus placement of a seton, which allows the sinus opening to heal naturally over several weeks. Setons are generally removed after three months",

Answer: Radiological Stage IV b describes a T4 lesion that invades adjacent organ(s), such as the urinary bladder or the pelvic floor musculature, resulting in fixation of the tumor mass, fixed or nonfixed. Note also that when evaluating for fixation to another structure one should also consider other structures close to or near the primary lesion because direct fixation may occur to those secondary organs, e.g., ureters, vagina. Fixation to only part of this region would imply N1 disease if fixation prevents surgery, chemotherapy must be given and downstage disease implies N0 is possible since it cannot become fixed to underlying viscera and thus MRI does not show positive margins or invasion into the urinary bladder.

Why was it necessary to emphasize the small nodule along the left internal iliac system? Answer: Besides N2 disease, you could reasonably expect to see liver and lung metastases. Pathologically confirmed primary or recurrent rectal carcinomas commonly involve local and regional lymph nodes. They often disseminate hematogenously through blood vessels into distant sites such as the liver and lungs, causing new masses that can be detected on MRI examination., Since the current case has high probability for spreading through extrarectal venous channels beyond the confines of surgery, one might wish to consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy prior to surgery. One purpose is to shrink down grossly visible tumors locally so that clear margins can be attained. Another rationale is to target occult foci of tumor spread outside of visualized tumor that cannot be assessed radiographically., Likely, the central slice represents penetrating rectal mucosa, while peripheral zone surrounds the rectum.

Grade II tumors contain some solid areas and may exhibit poorly formed glandular patterns. Mitotic activity must be minimal if it occurs only occasionally in random glands. Nuclear pleomorphism may occur sporadically in occasional cells. Grade III tumors display obvious signs of differentiation with solid areas containing well-formed glands indistinguishable from early invasive lesions. Frequent mitoses with nuclear pleomorphic changes are found deep into the glands.Severe degrees of nuclear atypia with cellular stratification and loss of polarity are common. These tumors often show less of an attempt at gland formation, with greater amounts of solid areas invading deeply through half or more of the thickness of the myometrium.Numerous irregular budding papillary infoldings and solid areas extend beyond the uterine serosa which appears puckered upwards toward the uterine serosa in this highly aggressive, poorly local disease spreading downward to the internal iliac vessels near the periphery.</s><s>",

REPORT: Wall thickening greater than or equal to 3 mm at the primary cancer site represents one of the two criteria that qualifies for the N1 designation. With no evidence of such thickening, T1 is assigned. Lack of significant size increases potential for lateral spread may factor into treatment decisions, which would not otherwise be made if the lesion were invasive cancer instead of non-invasive cancer. This allows clinicians another tool for stratification purposes. Positive margins carry added significance when it comes time for surgery because lack of circumferential involvement equates with better outcomes regardless of pathologic depth of penetration through the bowel wall. Absence of mesorectal lymph nodes may provide some benefit toward avoidance of systemic therapy since regional lymph nodes have no extension beyond the local area.

This is because endorphins, feelgood chemicals released during strenuous activity, help elevate your mood and keep you positive even after youve finished exercising for the day.Even if life events or other stressors outside of your workouts might still cause you temporary discomfort, youll usually eventually get back into a better headspace once you start moving again.Not only can being active improve your happiness now, studies show that people who engage in consistent fitness routines over time experience longterm improvements in their disposition.Working up a sweat at least three times every week not only improves your circulating energy levels throughout the rest of the week, research suggests that this kind of routine may increase the likelihood of your experiencing less anxiety and depression symptoms, leading to generally improved emotional wellbeing.Sweeping views.If your selfesteem issues are keeping you down, consider picking up activities like jogging, swimming, cycling, lifting weights, etc.Regular exercise improving confidence, helping reduce symptoms.G",

By convention this allows us set a threshold probability, called alpha , beyond which the likelihood that what we see really exists becomes statistically meaningful .For example, many studies reject the null hypothesis at p 0.05 or less (P < 0.05) to declare their results as statistically significant, while others accept the null hypothesis leaving the study only descriptive unless P exceeds 0.05.Because researchers control Type I error rates through sampling variation.

Although clinically relevant, it is not considered in pathologic stage or endpoints used for prognostic purposes, including overall survival or diseasespecific survival.

Answers: Lesions which would otherwise qualify for CT1 classification may nonetheless prove challenging if extensive transmural invasion precludes complete excision or necessitates wide margins owing to EMVI or nodal positivity. This appears to be such a case since the lesion extends well beyond the dentate line (which is not specifically designated). One cannot know whether adequate surgery was performed given competing agendas and compromising features. These include distant organ spread or unresectability and positive margins after chemotherapy during attempted curative resections.

Answers: The distance of the lowest tumor margin from the anal verge has remained constant. The polyp has shrunk to < 1mm in diameter. New findings relate to distant metastases which remain stable.REPORT: This large ulcerated lesion, extending from the dentate line and involving most of the colonic circumference along with multiple nodules throughout its length, should raise suspicion for a high grade invasive carcinoma with poorly differentiated histology. However, biopsies show highly dysplastic epithelium with basophilic nuclear remnants. Loss of polarity, glandular crowding, and disorganized necrotic debris all contribute toward this cytologically bland noninvasive lesion. Thus, given its appearance, this is not invasive but rather an unusually flat-appearing tubulovillous adenoma.

During the operation, the surgeon noticed perforating vessels penetrating through the bowel wall along with uncouniloca scarring and neovascularization adjacent to the ends of the stricture. These observations prompted preservation of the underlying vessel supply via placement of clips on those arterial branches supplying normal-appearing bowel proximal to the obstructing segment.Postoperatively, an enteroclysis was performed to rule out anastomotic stenosis, and histology confirmed high grade dysplastic epithelium associated with severe nuclear pleomorphism involving all layers of the bowel wall.

The previously reported measurement was obviously wrong because comparing it to the current scan would show something totally ridiculous like a gigantic neoplasm spanning several continents or nothing at all since the lumen is so collapsed. Therefore, one could argue that the exact size cannot be determined based on imaging alone.

Aronson , MD Author information Abstract INTRODUCTION--Chronic pain is common after thoracotomy or thoracostomy. Thoracic intercostal nerves may continue to stimulate somatic pain, especially when injured during rib spreading or retraction. The feasibility of continuous chest wall intercostal nerve block was explored in fresh cadavers. METHODS AND RESULTS --Two adult male cadaver shoulders were studied with ultrasound visualization to identify intercostal groove topography and chest wall thickness. Two sterile epidural catheters (Eifls 90 degrees apart) and two needles for local anesthetic injection were inserted at sites of optimal proximity to the appropriate intercostal nerve. Ultrasound confirmed adequate distribution. CONCLUSIONS --These findings suggested that continuously infusing a long acting local anesthesia around both the right and left sides of this individual's chest wall from third through sixth intercostal nerve coverage.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology offers great potential for asset management and real time person location. However, accuracy issues caused by signal fluctuations have prevented widespread use. We propose a new approach that uses multiple fingerprint regions which are separated spatially. Each region consists of a cluster of anchor points placed at different altitudes distributed throughout several floors of a building. Our method minimizes possible signal loss errors while maximizing the number of anchoring readings available in each individual fingerprint region. We use the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer to gather range measurements taken at various locations. These data then form the entry into our database. Accuracy experiments show that we achieve sub meter precision using five anchor point measurements. By using both horizontal and vertical angles, along with MAC ranges to determine tag position, we improve the system from only 45cm to subcentimeter levels. Thus, overall error reduces from nearly eight meters to under one meter. This paper presents indoor object tracking to four inches away. Also, we locate all detected objects to three centimeters away based upon current RSS proximity to the nearest reader. Therefore, this work locates the tag to nine centimeters away.,",

Our recent study further showed that serum cytokeratin fragment levels correlated significantly with the extent of liver metastases, overall survival rate, disease free survival rate and post operative complications of patients receiving hepatic resections for their colon carcinomas. Here we focused our attention to find out potential genetic alterations associated with both CK19+ positive cells and cytokeratin fragment expression in surgery specimens and peripheral blood samples taken at the same time. Methods: Twenty five paraffin embedded specimens obtained from resected primary lesions were immunohistochemially stained with antibody against cytokeratin protein using monoclonal antibodies against pankyrin (AKT) gene sequence. Results:Positive cells expressed strong diffuse membranous E-cadherin staining. In addition, some tumors exhibited membranous E-cadherin staining.

The accuracy of such systems heavily depends upon image processing techniques which extract useful information from the captured images. These extracted features then feed into neural networks or other types of pattern recognition models to obtain high accuracies in vehicles speeds limit detection. This paper presents an overview of existing technologies followed by an innovative technique capable of detecting four different speed limits namely 30 kmph, 60 kmph, 90 kmph, 120 kmph from a given video frame containing a detected vehicle using PSDS (Probabilistic Shape Descriptor based Speeded up Robust FISVM (Fundamentalist Independent Subspace Model). The proposed system works under nonstandard conditions like illumination variations, occlusion etc. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several existing algorithms thereby proving to give excellent accuracy even under challenging environments where several existing veical bounding boxes delineate each speed sign correctly.Index Terms Matching Keywords Related Phrases[embedded text]image processing,[embedded text]vehicle detection.[embedded text]frame, [embedded text]traffic signs detection.[embedded",

The tumor is completely encircling in its circumferential location and measures greater than 4 cm longitudinally. With respect to T-staging, it meets the criteria for both T2 and T3b. It invades all layers of the rectal wall and is close to the mesorectal fascia but not involved at this point. There is also proximity to Denonvilliers' fascia but not actual invasion. This would therefore qualify as stage T3b. There is involvement of the circumferential resection margin and there is some extramural extension. The anal sphincter appears to remain intact.

    "8038064": ": What was done for preoperative imaging? Was MRI or CECT used?, Answer: .REPORTPreoperative EvaluationUsing MRI to stage primary rectal tumors is recommended because of inherent contrast resolution limitations associated with ultrasound and CE, particularly when evaluating submucosal spread beneath neovascularization, fibrosis, and desmoplastic reaction characteristic of locally advanced disease. This technique affords detection of mesorectal fascia violations and determines appropriate surgical margins based on N3 nodal status at risk for metastatic extension into adjacent organs. If this cannot be evaluated, then either endoanal ultrasound or transrectal probebecore MRI (as indicated) should be performed according to local expertise.Regardless of method of detection, EMVI requires histological confirmation using HE slides and IHC techniques to evaluate c-myc gene expression (and probably other genetic alterations) will need to be incorporated with adjuvant therapy recommendations for node -, if positive.Question: Describe both ends of the specimen?Answer: +++ invasive rectal carcinoma grade III invasion through the muscularis propria into the proper rectal serosa invasion.Positive regional nodes were all grossly visible from below the dentate line.It appears to extend beyond the bowel wall and directly",

Most patients usually do not seek treatment until late stages when symptoms arise which may worsen their chance for survival. In addition to screening for early disease through pap smear programs, many countries in sub Saharan Africa lack sufficient diagnostic and therapeutic facilities hence the need for improvement. Patient selection criteria Methodology All consecutive histological confirmed cases were reviewed consecutively over five years . Results We identified 192 out of 206 (92%) that fulfilled our inclusion criterion which was less than 5mm measured from the base of the lesion to the closest edge.

These vector borne pathogens range in complexity from simple single celled organisms like bacteria and protozoans, fungi, virus and algae to complex parasites that require two or three host to complete their life cycle. Insect vectors may live and reproduce in the soil, water, plant material or animal body parts. The actual modes of transmission involve biting and salivary secretions from the vector as well as the contents of regurgitated stomach contents during the act of feeding. Hence the most common forms of transmission of many infectious agents occurs when the arthropod completes its feeding process along the skin of the victim.
